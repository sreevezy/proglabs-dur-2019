INTEREST OF CONTENT - OUTSTANDING
 - Content is interesting and relevant
 - Information is up-to-date
 - Each page contains several examples and, on some pages, links to other info sources

CONSISTENCY AND QUALITY OF VISUAL PRESENTATION - ACCEPTABLE
 - Navigation bar is very good
 - Author information is consistently presented
 - However, most of the rest of the visuals are very inconsistent
 - Pages have different sized headers
 - Some pages have images and contents sections, others do not
 - The 'Computer Hardware' page is completely different to all the other pages

QUALITY OF WRITTEN PRESENTATION - EXCELLENT
 - A few sentence structure errors on the 'The Internet' page
 - A few citation links that were not removed from the original source are present on the 'The Internet' page (eg. '[1]')
 - Other than that, written presentation is very good

VALIDITY OF HTML - EXCELLENT
 - Seems fine to me, don't really know

EVIDENCE OF COLLABORATION - SOUND
 - Author info is very limited, but not written by the author themselves
 - Daniel Stone has many more commits than everyone else
 - Seems to have been completed rather last-minute
