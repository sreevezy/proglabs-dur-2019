          How has social media made a difference?
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of people think that the use of social media has only negative
          consequences - this is fair enough. The widespread nature of social
          platforms has led to it causing harm, however, there are many examples
          of good that the internet, when combined with social media, has
          achieved.
          <br />

            <p>
              <strong>Fundraising</strong> is a great, and relevant, example of
              how the power of social media is being harnessed to do good in the
              world. Most recently, an initiative from YouTubers Mark Rober and
              MrBeast has raised over 14 million dollars out of a 20 million
              dollar target to plant 20 million trees across the globe.
              <a href="https://teamtrees.org/" target="_blank">Team Trees</a>.
              That's a lot of money - and a lot people - that have been able to
              donate through the power of the internet and social platforms such
              as YouTube, which lets you donate right there on the page. For
              every dollar donated, a tree will be planted. It's estimated that
              these trees will take up over 180 kilometers squared of land and
              hopefully each of the trees will be planted no later than December
              2022. Even some notable celebrities, including Elon Musk, have
              donated to the cause. Elon donated 1,000,000 trees, and soon after
              Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke donated 1,000,001 trees!

        <p>
          <br />It can be hard to help those in need after
          <strong>Natural Disasters</strong>, and social media can sometimes
          help with this. For example, after Hurricane Harvey in 2017, social
          media meant that regular citizens were offering their help and asking
          for addresses of those in need via Twitter. In addition to this
          kindness from users on social media, Twitter has proven an effective
          and fast means of getting a message out. This has been taken advantage
          of by emergency services to spread news as widely as possible, as
          quickly as possible.
          <br />
          <br />Finally, social media has made it easy to spread
          <strong>Happiness</strong> - there's nothing like watching a funny
          animal video when you need a mood boost. Even with the negativity
          being shared on social media, many users are still able to look past
          that and enjoy the positive news that can be found on these platforms.
