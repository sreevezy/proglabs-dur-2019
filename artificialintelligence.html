          There's no doubt that
          <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has a bad reputation.
          Most coverage from the media shows
          <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> stealing our jobs, and
          vastly outperforming humans driving us to extinction. Some of these
          claims may be true, however the currently
          <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> does much social good
          and is extremely useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and
          Agriculture couldn't seem further apart, the two fields work together
          very well in a time where crop shortages are a real threat to the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agriculture and farming is one of the oldest and most important
          professions in the world. Humanity has come a long way over the
          millennia in how we farm and grow crops with the introduction of
          various technologies. As the world population continues to grow and
          land becomes more scarce, people have needed to get creative and
          become more efficient about how we farm, using less land to produce
          more crops and increasing the productivity and yield of those farmed
          acres. Worldwide, agriculture is a $5 trillion industry, and now the
          industry is turning to AI technologies to help yield healthier crops,
          control pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, organize data for
          farmers, help with workload, and improve a wide range of
          agriculture-related tasks in the entire food supply chain.
        </p>

        <h2>AI helping to analyze farm data</h2>
        <p>
          Farms produce hundreds of thousands of data points on the ground
          daily. With the help of AI, farmers can now analyze a variety of
          things in real time such as weather conditions, temperature, water
          usage or soil conditions collected from their farm to better inform
          their decisions. For example, AI technologies help farmers optimize
          planning to generate more bountiful yields by determining crop
          choices, the best hybrid seed choices and resource utilization.
          <br /><br />
          AI systems are also helping to improve harvest quality and accuracy --
          what is known as precision agriculture. Precision agriculture uses AI
          technology to aid in detecting diseases in plants, pests, and poor
          plant nutrition on farms. AI sensors can detect and target weeds and
          then decide which herbicides to apply within the right buffer zone.
          This helps to prevent over application of herbicides and excessive
          toxins that find their way in our food.
          <br /><br />
          Farmers are also using AI to create seasonal forecasting models to
          improve agricultural accuracy and increase productivity. These models
          are able to predict upcoming weather patterns months ahead to assist
          decisions of farmers. Seasonal forecasting is particularly valuable
          for small farms in developing countries as their data and knowledge
          can be limited. Keeping these small farms operational and growing
          bountiful yields is important as these small farms produce 70% of the
          world’s crops.
          <br /><br />

          In addition to ground data, farmers are also taking to the sky to
          monitor the farm. Computer vision and deep learning algorithms process
          data captured from drones flying over their fields. From drones, AI
          enabled cameras can capture images of the entire farm and analyze the
          images in near-real time to identify problem areas and potential
          improvements. Unmanned drones are able to cover far more land in much
          less time than humans on foot allowing for large farms to be monitored
          more frequently.
