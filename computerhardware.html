        <p class="E animated rollIn">We see computer hardware everywhere in almost every walk of life,from the smart phones we use for our day to day
          convenience to gaming consoles to card readers in supermarkets and retail stores.Computer hardware has progressed
          exponentially over the years since 1936 when the first programmable computer(The Z1) was invented .Now there have been various
          innovative inventions such as Virtual Reality , smart home devices such as Amazon echo , drones and much more . Who knows where new 
          advancements in technology will take us in the future.

        <p class="h animated rollIn"id="SP">SMARTPHONES</p>
        <p class="E animated rollIn">Smartphones are type of mobile phones with multipurpose computing with many features like high hardware and operating system,
           Software, Internet and Multimedia functionality with basic phone functions and many more upgrades.
           Smartphones comes with all features and are everywhere in every part of the world now days every person is using a mobile phone as mobile phone comes with a variety of features and different prices.
           In short mobile phones are taking over our lives.

        <p class="E animated rollIn">We are all around computers. Computers play an important play in our day to day lives, like we are very much dependent them for doing many things
           such as giving users the ability to quickly and easily store and process data and the ability to create new software for increased productivity.
           Since the invention of computer they have evolved in terms of increased computing power and decreased size.
           Computer Generations has reached a different height with the use of a computer tasks which looked difficult before are made simpler by the use of a computer.

          <p class="h animated rollIn"id="SHD">SMART HOME DEVICES</p>
          <p class="E animated rollIn">Smart home technology generally refers to any suite of devices, appliances, or systems that connect into a common network that can be independently and remotely controlled.
             When your home technology works together in one system, it can also be referred more loosely as a “connected home”.
             For example, your home's thermostat, lights, audio speakers, TVs, security cameras, locks, appliances, and more are all connected into a common system,
             which can be controlled from your smart phone or through a mobile touch screen device.
             
             Smart home automation allows you to tap into high-tech functionality and luxury that wasn’t possible in the past.
              As technology development continues to expand, so will the possibilities for consumer home automation to make life easier and more enjoyable.

            <p class="h animated rollIn"id="STV">SMART TV</p>
            <p class="E animated rollIn">Smart TVs, much like smartphones and smart home devices, offer internet connectivity and support for a range of apps.
             This opens up a world of new entertainment options, from streaming video on Netflix and Hulu to playing games, checking social media, and controlling a whole house full of connected gadgets,
             including devices that work with Alexa and Google Home-compatible products.A growing number of models now include voice recognition tools, like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, for switching channels and searching for programs. 
             Most smart TVs will work with the smart speaker and a few will offer some or all of that same functionality built right into the TV.

            <p class="h animated rollIn"id="VR">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>
            <p class="E animated rollIn">Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience.
              Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds. By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world.
              The only limits to near-real VR experiences are the availability of content and cheap computing power.
              Virtual Reality’s most immediately-recognizable component is the head-mounted display (HMD). Human beings are visual creatures, and display technology is often the single biggest difference between immersive Virtual Reality systems and traditional user interfaces.
              The use of virtual reality as a training tool is well known, in particular in the field of surgery. Medical schools have adopted this technology as a way of teaching the next generation of surgeons.
