    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
            The Internet is the biggest world-wide communication network of computers.The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry many different kinds of information. The term is sometimes abbreviated as "the net". The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world.

            The Internet was developed in the United States by the "United States Advanced Research Projects Agency" (DARPA). The Internet was first connected in October, 1969[1] and was called ARPANET. The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a British (UK) scientist named Tim Berners-Lee.
            
            Today, people can pay money to access the Internet from internet service providers. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes people who offer these free services use advertising to make money. Censorship and freedom of speech on the Internet can be controversial.

    <h3 id="h1">Services on The Internet</h3>
    <p>
        The Internet is used for many things, such as electronic mail, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web.

        The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web (which is also called the "Web" or "www"). The web contains websites, including blogs and wikis like Wikipedia. Webpages on the Internet can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a password, or it is blocked).
        
        The second biggest use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one user to another. Instant messaging (such as AIM or ICQ) is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other faster.
        
        Some governments think the internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it. For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad. Many times no one in China can read it or add to it.[2] Another example of the internet being blocked is in North Korea.[3] Some parents block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see.

    <h3 id="h2">Dangers on the Internet</h3>
    <p>
        The Internet makes communication easy, and communication can be dangerous too. People often send secret information, and sometimes other people can steal that information. They can use the Internet to spread lies or stolen secrets or dangerously bad advice. For example, Facebook has had some problems with privacy settings. A person can post information on the website, but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing. One way to check for a secure website is to make sure the URL starts with https:// instead of http://. This means it is secured so other people cannot read information while it is being sent. However, it does not mean the website will do things to keep it safe.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some websites may trick people into downloading viruses that can harm a computer, or spyware that spies on its users (looks at what they are doing and tells someone else). E-mails can also have harmful files with them as "attachments".</li>
        <li>In internet chatrooms, people might be preying on others or trying to stalk or abuse them.</li>
        <li>The Internet contains content that many people find offensive such as pornography, as well as content intended to be offensive.</li>
        <li>Criminals may steal people's personal information or trick people into sending them money.</li>
    </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            New media and digital technologies have also positively contributed to better and more organized
            humanitarian responses. For example, in Haiti, where within hours of the earthquake extensive visualizations
            and data maps were created to assist in saving lives and reconstruction. Activists have been equipped to
            organize and coordinate protest efforts in Egypt, Tunisia, and Occupy. In addition an important by-product
            of these new interactions have been the way in which the international community can act as human rights
            monitors via data posted onto YouTube and other social media platforms.
